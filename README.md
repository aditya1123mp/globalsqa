# Intermediate Components Automation Project

This project focuses on automating various intermediate-level components and tasks, including scrollable elements, image uploads, and registration/login flows. Additionally, it includes small projects like automating a banking application. The goal is to provide practical examples of how to handle these tasks in web automation.

## Features

- **Scrollable Elements**: Automates interactions with scrollable components, ensuring that elements are properly accessed and manipulated even if they are off-screen.
- **Image Upload**: Automates the process of uploading images to a web application, handling file dialogs and validation.
- **Registration and Login**: Provides automation for user registration and login processes, ensuring secure and consistent authentication.
- **Small Projects**:
  - **Banking Application**: Demonstrates automation of common tasks within a banking application, such as balance checks, fund transfers, and account management.

## Technologies Used

- **Katalon Studio**: For creating and running the automation scripts.
- **Groovy**: Scripting language used within Katalon Studio for additional logic and customization.

## Project Structure

- `Test Cases/`: Contains the test cases for each automated scenario, including scrollable components, image uploads, registration/login, and the small banking project.
- `Object Repository/`: Stores the web elements identified for use in automation scripts, such as buttons, input fields, and file upload elements.
- `Global Variables/`: Stores variables that are used across multiple test cases, such as file paths for image uploads and user credentials.
- `Profiles/`: Contains environment-specific profiles for testing, such as development, staging, and production environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Katalon Studio**: Ensure that Katalon Studio is installed on your machine.
- **Access to Web Applications**: You should have access to the web applications you intend to automate, including any required credentials.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Katalon Studio.
3. Update global variables or profiles with your specific data, such as file paths, URLs, and credentials.
4. Run the test cases located in the `Test Cases/` folder to start the automation.

### Running the Tests

1. Open the specific test case you want to execute.
2. Click the "Run" button in Katalon Studio.
3. The script will perform actions such as scrolling, uploading images, registering new users, logging in, and interacting with the banking application.

## Customization

- **Scrollable Components**: Modify the scripts to handle different scrollable areas in your target application.
- **Image Upload**: Update the file paths in global variables to test different image files.
- **Registration/Login**: Customize the registration forms and login credentials as needed.
- **Banking Application**: Expand the banking test cases to cover more scenarios such as transaction history and loan applications.
